MOD DESCRIPTION - Full/updated version on Modrinth - [https://modrinth.com/mod/morevanillapotions]

There are many effects in Minecraft which do not have a corresponding potion. This mod intends to change it.

All potions have a corresponding splash potion, lingering potion and tipped arrow. Recipes are also included for each potion.

Potions added:

Potion of Blindness (1:00) - Azure Bluet + Awkward Potion

Potion of Mining Fatigue (1:00) - Prismarine Crystals + Awkward Potion

Potion of Decay (0:45) - Fermented Spider Eye + Regeneration Potion

Potion of Nausea (0:30) - Pufferfish + Water Bottle

Potion of Hunger (0:30) - Rotten Flesh + Awkward Potion

Potion of Levitation (0:45) - Fermented Spider Eye + Slow-Falling Potion

This is a must-have for PvP-based servers, as the splash potion variants are powerful in combat.

Changes may be made in the future to increase/decrease the potency and duration of each potion to balance gameplay.

Currently the mod only supports Forge for 1.20.1 but backports or NeoForge/Fabric/Quilt versions may be made available in the future.

Thanks to MCreator for providing tools to make this mod.
