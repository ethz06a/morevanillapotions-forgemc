MOD DESCRIPTION

There are many effects in Minecraft which do not have a corresponding potion. This mod intends to change it.

All potions have a corresponding splash potion, lingering potion and tipped arrow. Recipes are also included for each potion.

Potions added:

Potion of Blindness (3:00) - Azure Bluet + Awkward Potion
Potion of Mining Fatigue (3:00) - Prismarine Crystals + Awkward Potion
Potion of Decay (0:45) - Fermented Spider Eye + Regeneration Potion
Potion of Nausea (0:45) - Pufferfish + Water Bottle*
Potion of Hunger (0:30) - Rotten Flesh + Awkward Potion
Potion of Levitation (0:20) - Fermented Spider Eye + Slow-Falling Potion
This is a must-have for PvP-based servers, as the splash potion variants are powerful in combat.

* Water bottle, not awkward potion as it would create a water breathing potion instead

Changes may be made in the future to increase/decrease the potency and duration of each potion to balance gameplay.

Currently the mod only supports Forge for 1.20.1 but backports or NeoForge/Fabric/Quilt versions may be made available in the future.

I understand that there are multiple mods on Modrinth that have similar functionality, however I intend to focus on Forge at the present time, while other mods use Fabric

Thanks to MCreator for providing tools to make this mod.
